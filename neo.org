* Introduction
This is my personal Emacs configuration. This is not the first time
I declare [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsBankruptcy][Emacs bankrupcy]] and start over with a new emacs life.

It is not intended to be general or beginner-friendly. If you're a
beginner you'll probably be better off with one of the many emacs
configurations with batteries included.

Also, my Emacs stays on for weeks or months at a time; I'm not
interested in reducing startup time or delaying loading of packages
until they're first used. It simply doesn't affect me.
